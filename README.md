### I am a 21-year-old self-taught programmer specializing in programming language design. So far, I've been programming for approximately **three years**.  

For most people, programming is a tool to solve problems. But for me, programming **itself** is the problem I‚Äôm solving.  

#### üåü My Journey  
I started programming accidentally in **AutoHotKey** for a bit over a year, not even planning to become a programmer. But AutoHotKey only works on Windows, and I felt bound by its limitations. So, I decided to create something new and I didn‚Äôt even know I was going to make a new language. I just wanted to convert AutoHotKey-like syntax to JavaScript since it was the closest and easiest syntax to convert to and accidentally created **[HTH](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTH)**.  


- **[HTH](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTH)**: Converts AutoHotKey-like syntax to JavaScript. (**DEPRECATED**)
- **[HTpy](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTpy)**: Converts AutoHotKey-like syntax to Python. (**DEPRECATED**)
- **[HT++](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HT-plus-plus)**: Converts AutoHotKey-like syntax to C++ for high performance. (**DEPRECATED**)

# üöÄ HTVM: The Revolution in Programming  

## **HTVM: The Adaptive, Multi-Language, Customizable Syntax and Code Generation Engine**

HTVM is a revolutionary system that empowers **you to design your own programming language** with **fully customizable syntax**, tailored precisely to your needs and approach.

Write code using your personalized keywords, operators, and structure, and HTVM's powerful engine will **generate equivalent code** for **15 distinct target languages**:

**C++, Python, JavaScript, Go, Lua, C#, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Nim, AutoHotKey, Swift, Dart, TypeScript, and Groovy.**

HTVM fundamentally changes the programming experience with groundbreaking features:

- **Total Syntax Customization**: Define your own keywords, operators, block structures, comments, and more, without the limitations of traditional languages. Build a language that feels intuitive *to you*.
- **Multi-Target Code Generation**: Write your logic once in your custom HTVM language and generate native code for multiple platforms or environments simultaneously.
- **Simplified Dependency Management**: Leverage a rich set of built-in functions. HTVM automatically handles adding necessary library includes/imports in the *generated* code, reducing boilerplate in your HTVM source.
- **OSP (Ordinal Struct Programming)**: Utilize HTVM's built-in methodology for organizing code with hierarchical namespaces and explicit `struct` data containers. [See OSP Docs](#https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTVM/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#osp-ordinal-struct-programming)
- **Programming Blocks**: Seamlessly embed native code for any target language directly within your HTVM files for tasks requiring specific platform features or libraries. [See Programming Blocks Docs](#https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTVM/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#programming-blocks)
- **HTVM IDE**: Develop efficiently with a dedicated IDE featuring custom syntax highlighting (based on *your* rules), code completion, file management, and execution capabilities (JS execution directly, others via generated code).

HTVM aims to make programming faster, more accessible, more personalized, and ultimately, more powerful by putting you in control of the language itself.

#### üöÄ My Mission  
I‚Äôm solving problems in programming by removing unnecessary complexities and giving developers full control with HTVM. My goal is to transform programming into a more accessible, efficient, and revolutionary process.  

Feel free to explore **[HTVM](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTVM)** and its IDE **[HTVM IDE](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTVM/blob/main/README.md#%EF%B8%8F-htvm-ide)** to see how I‚Äôm changing the programming world.
