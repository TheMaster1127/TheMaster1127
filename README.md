**Self-Taught Programmer**
------------------

### I am a 21-year-old self-taught programmer specializing in revolutionizing programming. So far, I've been programming for approximately **two years**.

For most people, programming is a tool to solve problems. But for me, programming **itself** is the problem I‚Äôm solving.  

#### üåü My Journey  
I started programming accidentally in **AutoHotKey** for a bit over a year, not even planning to become a programmer. But AutoHotKey only works on Windows, and I felt bound by its limitations. So, I decided to create something new and I didn‚Äôt even know I was going to make a new language. I just wanted to convert AutoHotKey-like syntax to JavaScript since it was the closest and easiest syntax to convert to and accidentally created **[HTH](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTH)**. 


That‚Äôs how I ended up making my own programming languages:  
- **[HTH](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTH)**: Converts AutoHotKey-like syntax to JavaScript. Originally written in AutoHotKey, then rewritten in HTpy, and later also bootstrapped to work in the browser.  
- **[HTpy](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTpy)**: Converts AutoHotKey-like syntax to Python. Written in HTH and later bootstrapped in itself.  
- **[HT++](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HT-plus-plus)**: Converts AutoHotKey-like syntax to C++ for high performance. Written in HTpy.  

These languages were about bringing AutoHotKey‚Äôs ease and syntax to other environments, not focusing on the target languages themselves, but using them for their unique technologies‚ÄîPython for backend development, C++ for speed, and JavaScript for the browser and user interface (GUI). You can even use **[HT Workspace](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HT-Workspace)** to try out HTH and HTpy only directly in your browser even on mobile.  

#### üöÄ HTVM: The Revolution in Programming  
I created **[HTVM](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTVM)**‚Äîa programming language and engine inspired by my earlier languages but a hundred times more powerful. Built in HT++, HTVM converts code to JavaScript, Python, and C++, while introducing a groundbreaking approach to programming:  
- **Customizable Syntax**: Define your own syntax without restrictions.  
- **No More Libraries**: Forget importing libraries‚Äîeverything is built-in for simplicity and efficiency.  

HTVM solves the problems of traditional programming by making it simpler, more flexible, and revolutionary.  

#### üåê OSP: Objectively Simplified Programming Paradigm
Inside HTVM, I developed my own paradigm **[OSP (Objectively Simplified Programming)](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTVM/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md#osp-objectively-simplified-programming-paradigm)** because I strongly believe that OOP was a mistake. OSP eliminates the complexities of OOP while still supporting objects. It focuses on making object usage intuitive and powerful, offering a streamlined alternative to traditional paradigms.  

#### üõ†Ô∏è HTVM IDE  
To make programming with HTVM even easier, I created the **[HTVM IDE](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTVM/blob/main/README.md#htvm-ide)**, a powerful tool designed to enhance your development experience.  

#### üöÄ My Mission  
I‚Äôm solving problems in programming by removing unnecessary complexities and giving developers full control. With HTVM and OSP, my goal is to transform programming into a more accessible, efficient, and revolutionary process.  

Feel free to explore **[HTVM](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTVM)** and its IDE **[HTVM IDE](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTVM/blob/main/README.md#htvm-ide)** also **[HTH](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTH)**, **[HTpy](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HTpy)**, **[HT++](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HT-plus-plus)**, and **[HT Workspace](https://github.com/TheMaster1127/HT-Workspace)** to see how I‚Äôm changing the programming world.
